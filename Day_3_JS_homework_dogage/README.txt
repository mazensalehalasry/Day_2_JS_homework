-Write a function named calculateDogAge that
	-Takes 1 argument: your dog age
	-Calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years
	-outputs the result to the console like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
	-The function must return an object that has the dog year as a property inside it
	-In the object use the Number() method to convert the dog age from string to number
-HINT the console must accept the following dog.age and don't forget to use string templates!
-Push the code to the same HW repo please and don't create another one. 
thanks
